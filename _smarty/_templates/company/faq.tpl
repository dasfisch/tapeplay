    <h2>What is TapePlay?</h2>

    <p>
        TapePlay is a video sharing site built to transform recruiting. It lets players get the important exposure they
        need by just uploading a video. For coaches and scouts, we&rsquo;ve streamlined recruiting by making everything
        digital. It&rsquo;s about working smarter not harder. What used to require hours of sifting through stacks of
        DVDs now takes minutes.
    </p>

    <h2>Is TapePlay free?</h2>

    <p>
        TapePlay is free for public and Player accounts. Overall, the site is primarily supported by advertising,
        including video and visual marketing collateral.

    <h2>What are the recommended settings for uploading a video?</h2>

    <p>
        We prefer you upload your video in its original format and in the highest quality possible. We also like
        de-interlaced files. Audio and video lengths should always be the same with audio starting at the same time as
        the video. TapePlay supports a wide variety of video and audio formats.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here is a list of some well-known formats that TapePlay supports:<br/>AAC, AVI, 3GP, FLV, MOV, MP3, MP4, MPEG,
        OGG, WAV, WEBM, WMA, and WMV.

    <h2>How do I upload a video?</h2>

    <p>
        Remember, you have to be an athlete aiming to play at the next level in order to upload a video. The only other
        people who can upload a video are the featured athlete&rsquo;s parents and legal guardians. To upload a video,
        you&rsquo;ve got to create a Player account.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once you have a Player account, go to the upload page. This is where you can upload your video. Then hit the
        Browse button, select the file you want to upload from your computer, and hit the Select button. Your video will
        start uploading and you will see a progress bar telling you how long it will take. (Please note: slower
        connections and large files will take longer so please be patient.)
    </p>

    <p>
        After your video is finished uploading, it will go through a conversion process. Once uploaded, the video will
        appear both on the site and in your account. It&rsquo;s that simple.

    <h2>What should I do if something goes wrong or doesn&rsquo;t work?</h2>

    <p>
        If your problem doesn&rsquo;t work after multiple attempts, try holding down the Shift button on your keyboard
        and pushing the reload button on your browser. This will reset the cache in your browser and usually clear up
        any problems. If this still doesn&rsquo;t work, exit your browser, reopen it and try again.

    <h2>How do I get coaches to watch my videos?</h2>

    <p>
        Besides posting videos of your best games ever, it&rsquo;s all about your video titles and descriptions. The
        more detailed you are, the better chance a coach or scout will find you. Make your video titles clear, direct
        and accurate. And never ever be misleading.
    </p>
    <p>
        Email your video URL to colleges or professional organizations you are interested in playing for. Keep a log of every contact you make and remember to follow up.
