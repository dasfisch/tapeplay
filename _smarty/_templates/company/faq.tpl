            <p>
                TapePlay is a video sharing site built to transform recruiting. It let's players get the important exposure they need by just uploading a video. For coaches and scouts, we've streamlined recruiting by making everything digital. It's about working smarter, not harder. What used to require hours of sifting through stacks of DVDs now takes minutes.
            </p>
            <p class="header" id="freedom">Is TapePlay free?</p>
            <p>
                TapePlay is free for public and Player accounts. For coaches and scouts, there is a $199 annual subscription fee which opens up all of TapePlay's best features like <strong>VideoNotes</strong>. Overall, the site is primarily supported by advertising, including video and visual marketing collateral.

            <p class="header" id="videoSettings">What are the recommended settings for uploading a video?</p>
            <p>
                We prefer you upload your video in its original format and in the highest quality possible. We also like de-interlaced files. Audio and video lengths should always be the same with audio starting at the same time as the video. TapePlay supports a wide variety of video and audio formats. 
            </p>
            <p>    
                Here is a list of some well-known formats that TapePlay supports: AAC, AVI, 3GP, FLV, MOV, MP3, MP4, MPEG, OGG, WAV, WEBM, WMA, and WMV.

            <p>
                Want a quick overview of what may be an issue with your video's formatting? Pay attention to any warnings or error messages while you're uploading a video.

            <p class="header" id="upload">How do I upload a video?</p>
            <p>
                Remember, you have to be an athlete aiming to play at the next level in order to upload a video. The only other people who can upload a video are the featured athlete's parents and legal guardians. To upload a video, you've got to have a Player account.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you have a Player account, go to the upload page. This is where you can upload your video. Then hit the Browse button, select the file you want to upload from your computer, and hit the Select button. Your video will start uploading and you will see a progress bar telling you how long it will take. (Please note: slower connections and large files will take longer so please be patient.)
            </p>
            <p>
                After your video is finished uploading, it will go through a conversion process. Once uploaded, the video will appear both on the site and in your account. It's that simple.

            <p class="header" id="myVideos">How do I get coaches to watch my videos?</p>
            <p>
                Besides posting videos of your best games ever, it's all about your video titles and descriptions. The more detailed you are, the better chance a coach or scout will find you. Make your video titles clear, direct and accurate. And never ever be misleading. Being misleading leads to people thinking your deceptive.
