        <h2>Do's and Dont's: The Rules of Video</h2>
        <div class="dosanddonts">
            <h3>The Do's</h3>
            <p class="header">Comply with the NCAA rules. (Unless you are a professional athlete.)</p>
            <p>
                If you're not a professional athlete, your uploaded video(s) must be restricted to
                regularly scheduled (regular-season) high school, preparatory school or two-year college
                contests which the institution made no prior arrangements for recording.
            </p>
            <p class="header">You must have created the video you upload or participated in its content.</p>
            <p>
                You must own or have the right to upload a video. If a school has given you game footage, you do have the right to upload that video.
                You must have the right to use all the video content you upload, especially if it contains
                third party content such as video, music or images. Your video must not infringe third party
                copyrights or other intellectual property.
            </p>
            <p class="header">Please be cautious when posting something involving a child.</p>
            <p>
                Videos involving children (anyone under the age of 18) are particularly sensitive. Videos
                containing children should never be sexually suggestive or violent.
            </p>
            <h3>The Dont's</h3>
            <p class="header">Your video must not be intended for commercial use.</p>
            <p>
                You may not upload commercials, infomercials, demos, walkthroughs or any videos that sell
                or promote any product or service. You may not upload videos containing advertisements.

            </p>
            <p class="header">Don't spam. Everyone hates spam. So, don't be that guy (or girl).</p>
            <p>
                Don't create misleading descriptions or titles in order to increase views. Don't post large
                amounts of untargeted, unwanted or repetitive content.
                This will just annoy the people you're trying to impress and get you banned from the site
                so save yourself the trouble.
            </p>
            <p class="header">Your video cannot violate any of our other content restrictions.</p>

                <br /><br />
