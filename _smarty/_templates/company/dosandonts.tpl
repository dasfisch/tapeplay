	<h1>Do&rsquo;s And Don&rsquo;ts:<br />The Rules Of Video</h1>
	
	<h2>The Do&rsquo;s</h2>
	
	<h3>Comply with the NCAA rules. (Unless you are a professional athlete.)</h3>
	<p>
		If you&rsquo;re not a professional athlete, your uploaded video(s) must be restricted to regularly scheduled (regular&ndash;season) high school, preparatory school or two&ndash;year college contests which the institution made no prior arrangements for recording.
	</p>
	
	<h3>You must have created the video you upload or participated in its content.</h3>
	<p>
		You must own or have the right to upload a video. If a school has given you game footage, you do have the right to upload that video. You must have the right to use all the video content you upload, especially if it contains third party content such as video, music or images. Your video must not infringe third party copyrights or other intellectual property.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Please be cautious when posting something involving a child.</h3>
	<p>
		Videos involving children (anyone under the age of 18) are particularly sensitive. Videos containing children should never be sexually suggestive or violent.
	</p>
	
	<h2>The Don&rsquo;ts</h2>
	
	<h3>Your video must not be intended for commercial use.</h3>
	<p>
		You may not upload commercials, infomercials, demos, walkthroughs or any videos that sell or promote any product or service. You may not upload videos containing advertisements. If you are interested in advertising on TapePlay, contact our advertising department. <a href="#" title="Advertising">advertising@tapeplay.com</a>
	</p>
	
	<h3>Don&rsquo;t spam. Everyone hates spam so don&rsquo;t be that guy (or girl).</h3>
	<p>
		Don&rsquo;t create misleading descriptions or titles in order to increase views. Don&rsquo;t post large amounts of untargeted, unwanted or repetitive content. This will just annoy the people you&rsquo;re trying to impress and get you banned from the site so save yourself the trouble.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Your video cannot violate any of our other content restrictions.</h3>

		<li>DO NOT upload videos that depict animal cruelty or extreme violence towards animals in a context not related to sports involving humans (ex: Bullfighting or horseback riding/show jumping would be permitted but not cock or dog fighting).</li>
		<li>DO NOT upload videos that promote fraudulent schemes, multi&ndash;level marketing (MLM) schemes, get rich quick schemes, online gaming and gambling, cash gifting, work from home businesses, or any other dubious money&ndash;making ventures. </li>
