            <h3>We exist to make recruiting better.</h3>
            <p>
                For players, it means helping talented athletes get the important exposure they
                need to get to the next level. You upload a video and we put it in front of coaches
                and scouts across the country.
            </p>
            <p>
                For scouts and coaches, it means putting an end to the days of sifting through
                dozens of DVDs with a clipboard and pencil. We've brought recruiting into the digital
                world. Now, you can search through player videos by specific criteria, save videos,
                and use <span class="bold">VideoNotes</span> to instantly share notes and time stamps with your entire staff.
            </p>
            <p>
                The world's evolved. So has recruiting. Welcome aboard.
