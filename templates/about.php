            <h3>We Exist to Make Recruiting Better</h3>
            <p>
                For players, it means helping talented players get the exposure they
                need to get to the next level. You upload a video and we put it in
                front of coaches and scouts across the country.
            </p>
            <p>
                For scouts and coaches, it means putting an end to the days of sifting
                through dozens of DVDs with a clipboard and a pencil. We've brought
                recruiting into the digital world. Now, you can search through player
                videos by specific criteria, save videos, and use <strong>VideoNotes</strong>
                to instantly share notes and time stamps with your entire staff.
            </p>
            <p>
                The world's evolved. So has recruiting. Welcome aboard.
