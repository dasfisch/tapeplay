	</p>

	<h2>Browsing TapePlay</h2> 
	<p>
		You can watch videos on TapePlay without having a TapePlay Account. You can contact us by emailing us directly without having to register for an account at <a href="mailto:help@tapeplay.com" title="Email TapePlay Help">help@tapeplay.com</a>.
	</p>

	<h2>Your TapePlay Account</h2> 
	<p>
		For some of Tape Play&rsquo;s Services, like uploading videos, posting notes and saving videos, you must register for a TapePlay Account. We ask for some personal information (&quot;PI&quot;) when you create an account, including your name, email address and a password, which is used to protect your account from unauthorized access.

		We may record information about your usage of TapePlay&rsquo;s Services such as sports categories searched or viewed, the videos you watch, the frequency and size of data transfers, and information you display about yourself as well as information you click on in TapePlay (including userinterface elements and personal settings). If you are logged in we may associate that information with your TapePlay Account for the purposes of general marketing, to better serve you, and for optimizing web usage and deciding which advertisements to show.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Content Uploaded to Site</h2>

	</p>
	<p>

	<p>
		Your name (first and last), but not your email address, is displayed to other registered and non-registered users of TapePlay&rsquo;s Services when you upload videos.
